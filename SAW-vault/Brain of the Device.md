The brain is an organ located in the upper part of your head to control your behavior in various situations. It allows us to gain new information and experiences from the surrounding environment. Besides, this human organ can memorize and process unlimited amounts of data without any overlap or external intervention.

The microcontroller represents the device's brain. It mirrors how the human mind works. It helps the system to take feedback loops toward specific behaviors. The microcontroller's chip achieved a quantum leap in the technological field.

However, the device without the Microcontroller is considered as unintelligent. It does not sense the surrounding environment. That affects the accuracy and quality of task fulfillment. 

That chip achieved a colossal revolution in manufacturing. It transfers us to the fourth generation which is known as the smart century. Scientists start to produce numerous devices which are called smart.

The proper smart apparatus' definition is that "it is a device which can simulate or acclimate human behavior." 

Thinkers seek to create the future with a comfortable life. They generate the principles to achieve that scientific revolution. We are in the 21st-century. The question is "What is next?" Can we excel ourselves from where we are to achieve new Ages which will be known as wondrous ages?
